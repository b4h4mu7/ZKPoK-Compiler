  Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge allow one to prove possession or
  knowing of a certificate without actually revealing the secret. This
  involves using a hard problem as a basis for the protocol. Goals of
  current Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge compiler frameworks are
  to make this process easy for those outside the field of
  cryptography while at the same time making it easy for those inside
  the field to develop such protocols.

  We acknowledge that such frameworks have made it easy to develop the
  protocols but we note that they have not made it easy or general to
  those implementing the protocols on the end devices. Such frameworks
  either target C code generation or an interpreted language. They
  also use high-level multi-precision arithmetic libraries which are
  too resource hungry for small embedded devices. These limitations
  have motivated us to extend one of those frameworks and build our
  own framework from it. This framework is targeted specifically at
  small embedded devices while not losing any generality of the
  framework it extends.
