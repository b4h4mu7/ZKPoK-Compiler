\begin{abstract}
  Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge (ZKPK) are the key building block
  of numerous cryptographic schemes, such as anonymous authentication
  or anonymous e-cash. Implementing ZKPK has proved to be error-prone,
  which hinders the widespread deployment of such schemes. To ease
  implementation work, several cryptographically aware compilers and
  libraries have been proposed to provide ZKPK implementations in
  high-level languages such as C, C++ and Java. However, some
  cryptographic schemes are expected to be implemented in
  resource-constrained devices, such as RFID tags (anonymous
  authentication) or smart cards (anonymous e-cash). In such
  situations, a ZKPK compiler that targets hardware description
  languages and hardware-software co-design is convenient.

  We propose a custom ZKPK compiler framework that extends the CACE
  ZKPK compiler to enable hardware-software co-design. Concretely, our
  ZKPK compiler takes as input platform-independent implementations
  generated by the CACE ZKPK compiler and transforms them into
  implementations in LLVM IR, the representation language of the LLVM
  compiler framework. From LLVM IR, one can target multiple
  platforms. We provide a back-end for GEZEL, a hardware description
  language which also enables hardware-software co-design. We also
  provide a back-end for C+GMP, thus covering both ends of the
  co-design spectrum. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework,
  we take an existing system and implement Schnorr's Identification
  Protocol atop it in an automated way.
